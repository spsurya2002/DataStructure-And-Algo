Detecting phishing emails involves analyzing multiple components of an email. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the key components that help identify phishing attempts:

---

### **1. Email Header Analysis**
The header contains metadata about the email's origin and routing. Key elements to check:
- **From Address**: Does it match the claimed sender? (e.g., `support@amaz0n.com` vs. `support@amazon.com`)
- **Return-Path**: Should align with the sender's domain.
- **Received-SPF**: Checks if the sender's IP is authorized.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Validates email integrity via cryptographic signatures.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)**: Ensures SPF and DKIM alignment.
- **Reply-To Address**: Often different from the "From" address in phishing emails.
- **X-Headers**: Unusual headers may indicate manipulation.

---

### **2. Domain & URL Analysis**
Phishing emails often contain malicious links. Check:
- **Domain Age**: Newly registered domains are suspicious.
- **Typosquatting**: Misspelled legitimate domains (e.g., `paypai.com`).
- **Subdomains**: Excessive subdomains (`secure.login.paypal.com.example.net`).
- **HTTPS vs. HTTP**: Lack of HTTPS or invalid certificates.
- **Redirects**: Links that resolve to different domains.
- **URL Shorteners**: Masked destinations (e.g., `bit.ly`, `tinyurl.com`).

**Tools**: WHOIS lookup, VirusTotal, URLScan.

---

### **3. Email Content Analysis**
Phishing emails often use psychological triggers. Look for:
- **Urgency**: "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!"
- **Threats**: "Legal action will be taken if you don’t respond."
- **Grammar/Spelling Errors**: Poorly written content.
- **Generic Greetings**: "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be a known brand (e.g., Microsoft, PayPal).
- **Requests for Sensitive Data**: Asking for passwords, SSN, or credit card details.

**AI/NLP Techniques**:
- Sentiment analysis (urgency, fear).
- Named Entity Recognition (brands, personal info).
- Text similarity (comparing to known phishing templates).

---

### **4. Attachment Analysis**
Malicious attachments deliver malware. Check:
- **File Type**: `.exe`, `.js`, `.zip`, or macros in Office files.
- **Double Extensions**: `invoice.pdf.exe`.
- **Password-Protected Files**: Used to evade scanners.
- **Hash Reputation**: Compare against malware databases (VirusTotal).

**Tools**: Sandboxing (Any.Run, Hybrid Analysis).

---

### **5. Behavioral Indicators**
- **Unusual Sending Time**: Emails sent at odd hours.
- **Unrequested Emails**: You didn’t initiate the interaction.
- **Mismatched Branding**: Logos, colors, or fonts differ from the real company.

---

### **6. Authentication Protocols**
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Verifies if the sender's IP is allowed.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Ensures email integrity.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)**: Combines SPF + DKIM and defines policy.

**Example of a failed check**:
```
Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 192.0.2.1) smtp.mailfrom=scammer.com
```

---

### **7. Visual & Embedded Content**
- **Logo Spoofing**: Fake company logos.
- **Hidden Text**: White text on white background to evade filters.
- **Tracking Pixels**: Images loading from suspicious domains.

**Tools**: Email client "View Source" or MXToolbox.

---

### **8. Email Reputation**
- **Sender's IP/Domain Reputation**: Blacklisted senders.
- **Previous Complaints**: Check via services like Spamhaus.

---

### **How to Implement Detection**
1. **Rule-Based Checks** (Quick Wins):
   - Flag emails with mismatched `From` and `Reply-To`.
   - Detect known malicious domains or keywords ("verify your account").
   
2. **Machine Learning Models** (Advanced):
   - Train classifiers on features like:
     - Lexical features (word frequencies, bigrams).
     - Header authenticity (SPF/DKIM pass/fail).
     - URL risk scores.
   - Use frameworks like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combine rules (e.g., "fail SPF = +5 phishing score") with ML predictions.

### **Example Phishing Score Calculation**
| Component          | Weight | Score (0-10) | Weighted Score |
|--------------------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| SPF/DKIM Fail      | 30%    | 8            | 2.4            |
| Suspicious URL     | 25%    | 7            | 1.75           |
| Urgent Language    | 20%    | 6            | 1.2            |
| New Domain (<1 yr) | 15%    | 5            | 0.75           |
| Attachment Risk    | 10%    | 0            | 0.0            |
| **Total**         |        |              | **6.1 (Likely Phishing)** |

### **Next Steps for Your Project**
1. Start with **header analysis** (SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
2. Add **URL scanning** (API integrations like Google Safe Browsing).
3. Implement **content analysis** (keyword matching, then NLP).
4. Gradually incorporate **attachments** and **behavioral signals**.
